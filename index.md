# Welcome to Gilgamoth's Page

This is my attempt to help give back to the community by making some of the code I've written available back to the general community.

This started after agreeing to give a presentation at the Leeds [Technology User Group](https://www.technologyug.co.uk/) in October 2018, so it gives me somewhere to keep my projects and presentations.

My contributions will be available via my github site at [https://github.com/Gilgamoth](https://github.com/Gilgamoth)
