# Welcome to Gilgamoth's Page

This is my attempt to help give back to the technology community by making available some of the PowerShell code I've written over the years.

This started after agreeing to give a presentation at the Leeds [Technology User Group](https://www.technologyug.co.uk/) in October 2018, so it also gives me somewhere to keep my projects and presentations.

My contributions will be available via my github repository at [https://github.com/Gilgamoth](https://github.com/Gilgamoth)
